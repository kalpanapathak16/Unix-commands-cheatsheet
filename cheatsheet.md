The following table lists the Unix commands that I learned during the Version Control course:
| Command name | Usage                 | Examples |
| ------------ | --------------------- | -------- |
| PWD (Print Working Directory) | Shows the full path of the current working directory.
| cd        | Change the active or current directory| cd Desktop
| cd ..      | Move out of the current directory and back into the parent directory | cd ..|
| touch      | Create a new file based on the file type | touch example.txt or touch myfile.html|
| mkdir      | Create a new folder | mkdir unix-commands |
| cp         | Copy files or folders from one destination to another |
| mv         | Move files from one directory to another |
| grep       | Search for files, folders, and contents of files |
| history    | View history of most recently typed commands |
| ls         | Show the contents of the current working directory |

**Note**: Each of these commands has a set of helper instructions. These helpers provide detailed information about how you can run commands and how you can specify certain flags. For example, the `man` command (short for Manual). When called against a command, it displays a detailed manual of instructions for the specified command. For example, `man ls` shows the detailed manual of instructions for the `ls` (list) command. 
## Flags in conjuctions commands
| Flag | Usage|
| ls -l | Lists the file out, in list order, and shows the read or write permissions, owners and groups it belongs to |
| ls -a | Lists all files and directories including hidden ones|
